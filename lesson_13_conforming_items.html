            <p class="lead">
                Picture this: you've created the perfect character pose—heroic stance, expressive face, dynamic body language. But they're standing there in their default state, basically wearing digital underwear. To bring your character to life, you need <strong>clothes</strong>. Not just any clothes, but clothing that moves naturally with the figure, bends where it should, and looks like it actually fits. This is where <strong>conforming clothing</strong> becomes your superpower.
            </p>

            <p>
                Unlike regular props (which are static and rigid), conforming clothing is <strong>intelligent</strong>—it knows how to wrap itself around your figure and follow along as you pose. Bend an arm, and the sleeve bends with it. Move a leg, and the pants leg follows. It's like magic, but it's actually clever 3D technology working behind the scenes.
            </p>

            <p>
                In this lesson, you'll master one of the most essential skills for creating professional Poser artwork: dressing your characters. We'll cover everything from understanding what conforming clothing is and how it differs from props, to loading outfits, adjusting fit with morphs, working with smart props that automatically attach themselves, and managing multiple clothing layers. By the end, you'll be able to dress any figure in a complete, professional-looking outfit.
            </p>

            <p>
                This is where your characters transform from posed mannequins into fully realized individuals with style, personality, and visual interest. Let's get your figures dressed for success!

                <p>
                    Let's start by understanding what makes conforming clothing special. It's one of those Poser features that seems like magic when you first use it, but understanding how it works helps you use it more effectively.
                </p>

                <h3>What Is Conforming Clothing?</h3>

                <p>
                    Conforming clothing is 3D clothing that has been specially designed to <strong>automatically wrap around and follow a specific figure</strong>. Think of it like a second skin that knows the figure's skeletal structure and can bend, twist, and pose right along with it.
                </p>

                <h3>How Conforming Works: The Technical Magic</h3>

                <p>
                    When you "conform" clothing to a figure, here's what happens behind the scenes:
                </p>

                <div class="mermaid">
                    graph TD

                    style H fill:#4CAF50,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff
                </div>

                <div class="card" style="background: #e3f2fd; border-left: 4px solid #2196F3;">
                    <h4>🎯 The Key Concept: Matching Rigging</h4>
                    <p>
                        For clothing to conform, it must have been created with a <strong>rigging structure that matches the figure</strong>. A shirt designed for Poser's LaFemme figure has the same bone structure (shoulder, upper arm, forearm, hand) as LaFemme herself. When you conform it, each clothing bone aligns with its corresponding figure bone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is why you can't just take any 3D clothing from the internet and make it conform—it needs to be specifically designed for Poser and for the figure you're using.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>Real-World Analogy</h3>

                <p>
                    Think of conforming clothing like a <strong>puppet costume</strong>. Imagine a marionette puppet wearing a tiny jacket. The jacket isn't just glued to the puppet—it's designed with the same joints. When the puppet's arm bends at the elbow, the jacket's sleeve has an elbow too, so it bends naturally. That's exactly how conforming clothing works in 3D.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In contrast, a regular prop is like putting a <strong>cardboard box</strong> on the puppet. Sure, you can attach it, but it won't bend or deform—it stays rigid no matter what the puppet does.
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p><strong>💡 Why This Matters:</strong> Understanding that conforming clothing has its own skeleton helps you troubleshoot issues. When clothing doesn't follow a pose correctly, it's usually because the rigging doesn't perfectly match, or morphs are needed to adjust the fit. We'll tackle these problems later in this lesson!</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    Not all clothing in Poser works the same way. Let's break down the different types you'll encounter and how each behaves.
                </p>

                <h3>Conforming Clothing (The Main Event)</h3>

                <div class="card">
                    <h4>What It Includes</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Body covering garments:</strong> Shirts, pants, dresses, skirts, jackets, coats</li>
                        <li><strong>Footwear:</strong> Shoes, boots, sandals, socks</li>
                        <li><strong>Full body items:</strong> Bodysuits, jumpsuits, full armor sets</li>
                        <li><strong>Undergarments:</strong> Underwear, bras, slips (yes, layering matters!)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Behavior:</strong> Follows figure's skeleton automatically after conforming</p>
                    <p><strong>Library location:</strong> Usually under Figures → (Brand) → Clothing</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Smart Props</h3>

                <div class="card" style="background: #e8f5e9; border-left: 4px solid #4CAF50;">
                    <h4>✨ The Automatic Helpers</h4>
                    <p>
                        Smart props are props (not clothing) that <strong>automatically parent themselves</strong> to the correct body part when loaded. They're "smart" because they know where they belong!
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Common smart props:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Glasses/sunglasses:</strong> Auto-parent to head</li>
                        <li><strong>Hats and headwear:</strong> Auto-parent to head</li>
                        <li><strong>Jewelry:</strong> Necklaces (neck/chest), bracelets (hands/wrists), earrings (head)</li>
                        <li><strong>Held items:</strong> Some weapons, tools auto-parent to hands</li>
                        <li><strong>Hair:</strong> Technically a smart prop that parents to head</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Behavior:</strong> Auto-parent on load, move with that body part, but don't bend/deform</p>
                    <p><strong>Library location:</strong> Props → (Brand) → Accessories or Smart Props folder</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Dynamic Clothing</h3>

                <div class="card" style="background-color: #f3e5f5; border-left: 4px solid #9C27B0;">
                    <h4>💨 Physics-Based Clothing (Advanced)</h4>
                    <p>
                        Dynamic clothing uses <strong>physics simulation</strong> to drape and flow realistically. Instead of conforming to the figure, it calculates how fabric would actually behave with gravity, wind, and movement.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Flowing capes, long dresses, flags, curtains</p>
                    <p><strong>When to use:</strong> When you need realistic fabric draping and flow</p>
                    <p><strong>Complexity:</strong> More advanced—requires cloth simulation setup</p>
                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> We'll cover basic dynamic cloth in advanced lessons. For now, focus on conforming clothing!</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Rigid Props (Non-Conforming)</h3>

                <div class="card">
                    <h4>The Traditional Props</h4>
                    <p>
                        Regular props that you manually parent to figures, like we learned in Lesson 10.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Weapons, bags, tools, cups, books</p>
                    <p><strong>Behavior:</strong> Rigid, move as one piece, require manual parenting</p>
                    <p><strong>When to use:</strong> For items that don't need to deform (hard objects)</p>
                </div>

                <h3>The Clothing Hierarchy</h3>

                <p>
                    When dressing a figure, think in layers from closest to skin to outermost:

                <p>
                    Each layer needs to fit over the previous layer without clipping through it. This is why clothing often comes with morphs to adjust thickness and fit.

                <h3>Compatibility: Figure-Specific Clothing</h3>

                <div class="card" style="background-color: #fff3cd; border-left: 4px solid #ffc107;">
                    <h4>⚠️ Critical Rule: Clothing Must Match Figure</h4>
                    <p>
                        Conforming clothing is designed for <strong>specific figures</strong>. You cannot mix and match freely between different figure types without issues.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Examples of figure compatibility:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>LaFemme clothing</strong> works on LaFemme figures</li>
                        <li><strong>Andy clothing</strong> works on Andy figures (the male equivalent)</li>
                        <li><strong>Genesis 8 clothing</strong> works on Genesis 8 figures (DAZ content)</li>
                        <li><strong>Victoria 4 clothing</strong> works on Victoria 4 figures (older generation)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>What happens if you try wrong clothing?</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Won't conform properly</li>
                        <li>Wrong size (huge or tiny)</li>
                        <li>Won't follow poses correctly</li>
                        <li>Massive poke-through and clipping</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Always check clothing description for compatible figures before purchasing or using!</p>
                </div>

                <blockquote>
                    <p><strong>💡 Shopping Tip:</strong> When buying clothing from content stores, the product page always lists compatible figures. Make sure your figure is on that list! Many clothing sets work with multiple figure generations, but never assume—always check.</p>

                <h3>Auto-Conform vs. Manual Conform</h3>

                <p>
                    Some clothing items are set to <strong>auto-conform</strong> when loaded. This means step 5 above happens automatically—the clothing conforms immediately upon loading. Other times, you need to manually conform using the Figure menu.
                </p>

                    <h4>✅ How to Tell If Clothing Is Conformed</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Visual check:</strong> Clothing wraps naturally around figure, follows pose</li>
                        <li><strong>Hierarchy check:</strong> Look at hierarchy panel
                            <ul>
                                <li>Conformed: Clothing appears nested under figure</li>
                                <li>Not conformed: Clothing is separate in hierarchy</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Pose test:</strong> Move figure's arm
                            <ul>
                                <li>Conformed: Clothing sleeve moves with arm</li>
                                <li>Not conformed: Clothing stays in place, arm pokes through</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                <h3>Unconforming Clothing</h3>

                <p>
                    Sometimes you need to unconform clothing (turn it back into a regular prop):
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>When:</strong> If you want to parent it differently or it's not working right</li>
                    <li><strong>How:</strong> Select clothing → Figure → Unconf orm</li>
                    <li><strong>Result:</strong> Clothing becomes independent prop, stops following figure</li>
                    <li><strong>Then:</strong> Can delete it, reconform to different figure, or manually parent</li>
                </ul>

                <blockquote>
                    <p><strong>💡 Pro Tip:</strong> Before conforming clothing, make sure your figure is selected and that it's the figure you want! With multiple figures in a scene, clothing can auto-conform to the wrong one. If that happens, simply select the clothing and use Figure → Conform To to switch it to the correct figure.</p>

                <h2>🔧 Adjusting Fit with Morphs</h2>
                
                <p>
                    Even with perfect conforming, clothing rarely fits absolutely perfectly right out of the box. This is where <strong>clothing morphs</strong> save the day. Think of morphs as the tailoring tools of the 3D world.
                </p>

                <h3>Why Fit Adjustments Are Needed</h3>

                <p>
                    Several factors can cause fit issues:
                </p>

                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Common Fit Problems</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Poke-through:</strong> Body parts (breasts, shoulders, knees) poke through clothing</li>
                        <li><strong>Figure morphs:</strong> If you morphed your figure (taller, more muscular, different body shape), clothing may not match</li>
                        <li><strong>Extreme poses:</strong> Very bent limbs or twisted torsos can cause clothing to pull or clip</li>
                        <li><strong>Layering:</strong> Wearing clothing over other clothing requires the outer layer to be slightly bigger</li>
                        <li><strong>Different figure versions:</strong> Even within same figure type, proportions can vary</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>Types of Clothing Morphs</h3>

                    <h4>🎚️ Fit Morphs (The Most Important)</h4>
                    <p>
                        These adjust how closely clothing hugs the figure or how loose it is:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Tightness/Looseness:</strong> Make clothing tighter or looser overall</li>
                        <li><strong>Body part specific:</strong> 
                            <ul>
                                <li>Bust adjust (for shirts, dresses)</li>
                                <li>Hips adjust</li>
                                <li>Shoulders adjust</li>

                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Smooth/Tighten:</strong> Pull clothing closer to body to eliminate poke-through</li>
                        <li><strong>Expand/Thicken:</strong> Make clothing bigger for layering</li>

                    <p>
                        These match specific figure body morphs:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>What they are:</strong> If your figure uses "BodyBuilder" morph, clothing may have matching "BodyBuilder" morph</li>
                        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Automatically adjust clothing to match figure's shape changes</li>
                        <li><strong>How to use:</strong> If you morphed your figure, look for matching morphs in clothing</li>
                        <li><strong>Common matching morphs:</strong> Muscular, Thin, Heavy, Tall, Short, Breast Size variations</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul style="color: white;">
                        <li><strong>Work from different camera angles:</strong> Poke-through might be hidden from one angle but visible from another</li>
                        <li><strong>Pose first, fit second:</strong> Get your pose right, THEN adjust clothing. Morphs needed depend on pose</li>
                        <li><strong>Less is more:</strong> Over-morphing makes clothing look wrong. Start small (0.1-0.2)</li>
                        <li><strong>Body-part specific:</strong> Most clothing lets you morph individual body parts separately—use this!</li>
                        <li><strong>Save morph combinations:</strong> If you find a good combination, note the values for future use</li>
                        <li><strong>Test renders:</strong> What looks fine in viewport might show problems in render (or vice versa)</li>
                        <li><strong>Layer strategically:</strong> Inner layer tight, outer layers progressively looser</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                    <h4>⚠️ When Morphs Aren't Enough</h4>
                    <p>
                        Sometimes morphs can't fix severe issues:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Completely wrong figure:</strong> Clothing designed for different figure—get correct clothing</li>
                        <li><strong>Extreme body morphs:</strong> If you made figure drastically different, clothing may not have enough morphs</li>
                        <li><strong>Poor quality clothing:</strong> Some clothing just isn't well-made—limited morph options</li>
                        <li><strong>Extreme pose limits:</strong> Some poses break any clothing (yoga positions, etc.)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Solutions:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Try different clothing that fits better</li>
                        <li>Reduce figure body morphs slightly</li>
                        <li>Use less extreme poses</li>
                        <li>Hide problem areas with camera angles</li>
                        <li>Advanced: Use cloth room for dynamic simulation</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <blockquote>
                    <p><strong>🎯 The Morphing Mindset:</strong> Think of morphs like a tailor making adjustments. A little tuck here, a little let-out there. You're not redesigning the clothing—you're fine-tuning the fit. Small, strategic adjustments usually solve 90% of fit issues!</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    Now let's talk about smart props—those clever accessories that know exactly where they belong on your figure without you having to manually parent them!
                </p>

                <h3>What Makes Props "Smart"?</h3>

                <p>
                    A smart prop is a regular prop with <strong>built-in parenting information</strong>. The creator embedded instructions that tell Poser: "When loaded, automatically parent me to [specific body part]."

                    <h4>The Easy Process</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Make sure figure is loaded</strong> (smart prop needs a parent!)</li>
                        <li><strong>Select your figure</strong> (smart prop will parent to active figure if multiple in scene)</li>
                        <li><strong>Navigate to smart prop in library</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Usually in: Props → [Brand] → Accessories</li>

                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Fine-tune position if needed</strong>

                                <li>Rotate if not quite right</li>
                                <li>Scale if size is off</li>

                <h3>When Smart Props Need Adjustments</h3>

                <p>
                    Smart props are pre-positioned for the default figure. If you've morphed your figure or used a different pose, adjustments may be needed:
                </p>

                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Common Adjustments</h4>
                    
                    <p><strong>Glasses:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>May need Z-translate (forward/back) to sit on nose properly</li>
                        <li>May need scale if head is morphed larger/smaller</li>
                        <li>May need slight rotation if head is tilted</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Hats:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>May need Y-translate (up/down) to sit at right height</li>
                        <li>May need scale for different head sizes</li>
                        <li>May sink into hair—adjust positioning</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Jewelry:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Necklaces may need length adjustment (Y-translate)</li>
                        <li>Bracelets may need scale for different wrist sizes</li>
                        <li>Earrings usually perfect as-is</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>Smart Props and Multiple Figures</h3>

                <div class="card" style="background-color: #fff3cd; border-left: 4px solid #ffc107;">
                    <h4>⚠️ Important: Which Figure Gets the Smart Prop?</h4>
                    <p>
                        If you have multiple figures in your scene, smart props will parent to the <strong>currently selected figure</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Best practice:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Select the specific figure you want to dress/accessorize</li>
                        <li>Then load smart props</li>
                        <li>They'll attach to that figure</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>If smart prop attaches to wrong figure:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Select the smart prop</li>
                        <li>Object → Change Parent</li>
                        <li>Select correct body part on correct figure</li>
                        <li>May need to reposition</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                <h3>Creating Collections with Smart Props</h3>

                <h3>Hair: The Special Smart Prop</h3>

                <p>
                    Hair in Poser is technically a smart prop, but it's special enough to warrant its own mention:
                </p>

                <div class="card">
                    <h4>💇 Working with Hair Props</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Location:</strong> Usually in Hair library category (not Props)</li>
                        <li><strong>Loading:</strong> Auto-parents to head like other smart props</li>
                        <li><strong>Fitting:</strong> Often has morphs to adjust fit, length, style</li>
                        <li><strong>Multiple hair pieces:</strong> Can load multiple (bangs, ponytail, etc.)</li>
                        <li><strong>Dynamic hair:</strong> Some hair uses physics simulation (advanced)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Load hair AFTER clothing. Clothing may cover head area and you need to see how hair interacts with clothing (collars, hoods, etc.)</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p><strong>✨ The Smart Props Advantage:</strong> Smart props save you time and frustration. Instead of manually parenting and positioning every accessory, you get instant results. It's the difference between spending 30 seconds or 5 minutes per accessory. Over a complete character outfit, that adds up to significant time savings!</p>

                <h2>👚 Managing Clothing Layers</h2>
                
                <p>
                    In the real world, we don't just put on clothes—we layer them. Underwear, then shirt, then jacket. Each layer sits over the previous one. In Poser, managing multiple clothing layers is both an art and a science.
                </p>

                <h3>The Layering Principle</h3>

                <p>
                    Just like real clothing, 3D clothing layers need to be ordered properly:
                </p>

                <div class="mermaid">
                    graph TD
                    A[Naked Figure<br/>Base Layer] --> B[Layer 1: Undergarments<br/>Closest to skin]
                    B --> C[Layer 2: Base Clothing<br/>Shirt, pants, dress]
                    C --> D[Layer 3: Mid Layer<br/>Vest, sweater]
                    D --> E[Layer 4: Outer Layer<br/>Jacket, coat]
                    E --> F[Layer 5: Accessories<br/>Belt, scarf, jewelry]
                    F --> G[Layer 6: Held/Carried<br/>Bag, weapon, prop]
                    
                    style A fill:#ff6b6b,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff
                    style G fill:#4CAF50,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff
                </div>

                <h3>The Loading Order Strategy</h3>

                <p>
                    <strong>Load clothing in layer order—innermost to outermost.</strong> This helps prevent issues and makes adjustments easier.
                </p>

                <div class="card" style="background: #e8f5e9; border-left: 4px solid #4CAF50;">
                    <h4>✅ Proper Loading Sequence</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Start with figure</strong> (obviously!)</li>
                        <li><strong>Load undergarments</strong> (if visible or if affecting outer layers)
                            <ul>
                                <li>Bra, underwear, undershirt</li>
                                <li>Conform to figure</li>
                            </ul>

                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Load mid layers</strong> (if any)

                                <li>Belts, scarves, jewelry</li>
                                <li>Smart props and regular props</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Finally, add hair</strong> (interacts with clothing collars/hoods)</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                <h3>Morphing for Layers</h3>

                <p>
                    Each outer layer needs to be slightly bigger than the layer beneath it. This is where layer morphs become essential:
                </p>

                        <li>Check sleeves: may need "Arm Thickness" adjustment</li>
                        <li>Check shoulders: may need "Shoulder Width" adjustment</li>
                        <li>Result: Jacket sits naturally over shirt</li>

                <h3>The Hierarchy Panel: Your Layering Manager</h3>

                <p>
                    The hierarchy panel shows you all clothing items and their relationship to the figure. Use it to manage complex outfits:

                    <h4>⚠️ Common Layering Problems</h4>
                    
                    <p><strong>Problem: Inner layer poking through outer layer</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Increase outer layer's expand morph</li>
                        <li>OR decrease inner layer's tight/conform morph</li>
                        <li>Check specific problem areas (elbows, knees, shoulders)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Problem: Too much gap between layers (floating clothing)</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reduce outer layer's expand morph slightly</li>
                        <li>Layers should be close but not clipping</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Problem: Can't tell which layer is which</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use hierarchy panel</li>
                        <li>Rename items clearly</li>
                        <li>Toggle visibility to isolate layers</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Problem: Scene getting slow with many layers</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hide body parts under clothing (see next section)</li>
                        <li>Lower preview quality</li>
                        <li>Work on layers separately, combine for final render</li>

                <h3>Layer Textures and Materials</h3>

                <p>
                    Beyond fit, consider visual layering:
                </p>

                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Visual Layering Tips</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Color coordination:</strong> Layers should look intentional together</li>
                        <li><strong>Texture variety:</strong> Mix smooth and textured fabrics for visual interest</li>
                        <li><strong>Edge visibility:</strong> Inner layers should be visible at edges
                            <ul>
                                <li>Shirt collar visible above jacket neckline</li>
                                <li>Shirt cuffs visible beyond jacket sleeves</li>
                                <li>This proves layering is real</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Material differences:</strong> Different shader properties for different materials
                            <ul>
                                <li>Cotton shirt: matte, less reflective</li>
                                <li>Leather jacket: slight gloss, more reflective</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                <blockquote>
                    <p><strong>👔 The Layering Rule of Thumb:</strong> In the real world, we instinctively know a jacket goes over a shirt. Apply that same logic in 3D. Load in order, expand progressively, and check from multiple angles. If it looks wrong, it is wrong—trust your eye and adjust until it looks natural!</p>

                <h2>👁️ Hiding Body Parts for Performance</h2>
                
                <p>
                    Here's a pro technique that both improves performance and solves poke-through problems: <strong>hiding body parts that are completely covered by clothing</strong>.
                </p>

                <h3>Why Hide Body Parts?</h3>

                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Benefits of Hiding Covered Geometry</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Performance improvement:</strong> Less geometry = faster viewport and faster renders</li>
                        <li><strong>Eliminates poke-through:</strong> Can't poke through if body part isn't there!</li>
                        <li><strong>Cleaner workflow:</strong> Less visual clutter when working</li>
                        <li><strong>Simpler morph adjustments:</strong> Focus on visible clothing only</li>
                        <li><strong>Professional technique:</strong> This is what the pros do!</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>What to Hide and When</h3>

                <div class="card" style="background: #e8f5e9; border-left: 4px solid #4CAF50;">
                    <h4>✅ Safe to Hide</h4>
                    
                    <p><strong>Full Coverage Scenarios:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Long sleeve shirt:</strong> Hide arms, hands (if gloves too)</li>
                        <li><strong>Long pants:</strong> Hide legs, feet (if shoes too)</li>
                        <li><strong>Full body suit:</strong> Hide torso, arms, legs</li>
                        <li><strong>Gloves:</strong> Hide hands</li>
                        <li><strong>Shoes/Boots:</strong> Hide feet</li>
                        <li><strong>Helmet with visor:</strong> Hide head (if completely covered)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Rule:</strong> If camera will NEVER see it, hide it!</p>
                </div>

                <div class="card" style="background-color: #fff3cd; border-left: 4px solid #ffc107;">
                    <h4>⚠️ Don't Hide These</h4>
                    
                    <p><strong>Visible Body Parts:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Exposed skin:</strong> Obvious—if it shows, it stays</li>
                        <li><strong>Head/Face:</strong> Unless completely covered by helmet</li>
                        <li><strong>Hands:</strong> If no gloves or sleeves ride up</li>
                        <li><strong>Feet:</strong> If wearing sandals or going barefoot</li>
                        <li><strong>Partial coverage:</strong> Short sleeves showing forearms</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Don't hide body parts you might need to show from different camera angles!</p>

                <h3>How to Hide Body Parts</h3>

                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Method 1: Using the Hierarchy Panel (Easiest)</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Open hierarchy panel</strong> (usually on left side)</li>
                        <li><strong>Expand your figure</strong> to see body parts</li>
                        <li><strong>Find the body part to hide</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Example: Left Forearm, Right Hand, Left Foot</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Click the eye icon</strong> next to that body part
                            <ul>
                                <li>Eye open = visible</li>
                                <li>Eye closed/crossed = hidden</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Repeat for other body parts</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Body parts remain hidden</strong> in viewport and renders</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>To unhide:</strong> Click the eye icon again to toggle visibility back on</p>
                </div>

                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Method 2: Using Properties Panel</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Select the body part</strong> (click on it in viewport or hierarchy)</li>
                        <li><strong>Open Properties panel</strong> (Window → Properties)</li>
                        <li><strong>Find "Visible" checkbox</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Uncheck "Visible"</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Body part disappears</strong></li>

                <p>
                    How much does hiding body parts help?
                </p>

                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Performance Comparison</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Full figure visible + clothing:</strong> 100% geometry load</li>
                        <li><strong>Hide arms and legs:</strong> ~40-50% reduction</li>
                        <li><strong>Hide torso, arms, legs:</strong> ~60-70% reduction</li>
                        <li><strong>Full armor (most hidden):</strong> ~70-80% reduction</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Result:</strong> Noticeably faster viewport, significantly faster rendering</p>

                    <h4>⚠️ Common Issues</h4>
                    
                    <p><strong>Problem: Hidden body part shows in final render</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Cause:</strong> Clothing transparent or camera angle reveals gap</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Unhide that body part, or adjust clothing</p>
                    <br>
                    
                    <p><strong>Problem: Forgot what I hid</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Check hierarchy panel—hidden items have closed eye icon</p>
                    <br>
                    
                    <p><strong>Problem: Want to quickly unhide everything</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Go through hierarchy and click each closed eye icon. Or reload figure (loses clothing though)</p>
                    <br>
                    
                    <p><strong>Problem: Clothing looks weird after hiding body parts</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Cause:</strong> Some clothing uses body parts as reference for positioning</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Unhide the body part—this is rare but can happen</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Hiding vs. Transparency</h3>

                <p>
                    Some people try to use transparency instead of hiding. Here's why that doesn't work as well:
                </p>

                <table class="data-table">
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Approach</th>
                            <th>How It Works</th>
                            <th>Performance</th>
                            <th>Best Use</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td><strong>Hiding (visibility off)</strong></td>
                            <td>Geometry not rendered at all</td>
                            <td>Excellent - geometry doesn't exist</td>
                            <td>Completely covered body parts</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td><strong>Transparency</strong></td>
                            <td>Geometry rendered but invisible</td>
                            <td>Poor - still calculates geometry</td>
                            <td>When you need the volume but not the surface</td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>

                <p>
                    <strong>Verdict:</strong> For completely covered body parts under clothing, always use hiding (visibility off), not transparency!
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p><strong>🎯 The Visibility Mindset:</strong> Think of hiding body parts like a movie set. The camera only films one angle—the back of the set doesn't need to exist. In 3D, if the camera will never see it and it's completely covered, it doesn't need to render. Save that computing power for what matters!</p>

                <p>
                    Even with all this knowledge, things can still go wrong. Let's tackle the most common clothing problems and their solutions.
                </p>

                <h3>Issue 1: Poke-Through</h3>

                <div class="card" style="background-color: #fff3cd; border-left: 4px solid #ffc107;">
                    <h4>⚠️ The Most Common Problem</h4>
                    <p><strong>Symptom:</strong> Body parts (breasts, shoulders, knees, elbows) poke through clothing</p>
                    <p><strong>Causes:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Clothing not morphed to match figure's body shape</li>
                        <li>Extreme pose causing clothing to pull tight</li>
                        <li>Clothing designed for different body proportions</li>
                        <li>Multiple clothing layers fighting for same space</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Solutions (try in order):</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Apply fit morphs:</strong> Bust adjust, smooth chest, expand, etc. (values: +0.2 to +0.5)</li>
                        <li><strong>Check for matching body morphs:</strong> If figure is "Muscular 0.8", apply "Muscular" morph to clothing too</li>
                        <li><strong>Adjust pose slightly:</strong> Sometimes small pose change eliminates problem</li>
                        <li><strong>Hide the body part:</strong> If completely covered, just hide it!</li>
                        <li><strong>Camera angle:</strong> Position camera to not show the problem (last resort)</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                <h3>Issue 2: Clothing Won't Conform</h3>

                <div class="card" style="background-color: #fff3cd; border-left: 4px solid #ffc107;">
                    <h4>⚠️ The "Why Won't It Work?" Problem</h4>
                    <p><strong>Symptom:</strong> Figure → Conform To is grayed out, or clothing doesn't wrap around figure</p>
                    <p><strong>Causes & Solutions:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Wrong figure type:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Cause: Clothing designed for different figure (LaFemme clothing on Genesis 8 figure)</li>
                                <li>Solution: Get correct clothing for your figure type</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Not actually conforming clothing:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Cause: Loaded a regular prop thinking it was clothing</li>
                                <li>Solution: Check library category—should be in Clothing or Figures</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>No figure loaded:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Cause: Conforming needs a figure to conform TO</li>
                                <li>Solution: Load figure first, then clothing</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Corrupted clothing file:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Cause: File installation error or download problem</li>
                                <li>Solution: Reinstall the clothing content</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>Issue 3: Clothing Explodes or Looks Distorted</h3>

                <div class="card" style="background-color: #fff3cd; border-left: 4px solid #ffc107;">
                    <h4>⚠️ The "What Happened?!" Problem</h4>
                    <p><strong>Symptom:</strong> Clothing loads looking stretched, distorted, or pieces flying everywhere</p>
                    <p><strong>Causes & Solutions:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Figure in extreme pose when clothing loaded:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Cause: Clothing tries to match extreme pose immediately, can't handle it</li>
                                <li>Solution: Put figure in zero pose (T-pose), load clothing, THEN pose figure</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Scale mismatch:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Cause: Figure or clothing has wrong scale value</li>
                                <li>Solution: Check scale in parameters—should be around 100%</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Rigging problem:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Cause: Clothing file has broken rigging data</li>
                                <li>Solution: Reinstall clothing or contact content creator</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>Issue 4: Clothing Moves Separately from Figure</h3>

                <div class="card" style="background-color: #fff3cd; border-left: 4px solid #ffc107;">
                    <h4>⚠️ The "It's Not Following" Problem</h4>
                    <p><strong>Symptom:</strong> Move figure's arm, clothing sleeve doesn't move with it</p>
                    <p><strong>Cause:</strong> Clothing not properly conformed</p>
                    <p><strong>Solutions:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Check conforming status:</strong> Look in hierarchy—is clothing nested under figure?</li>
                        <li><strong>Reconform:</strong> Select clothing → Figure → Conform To → Select figure</li>
                        <li><strong>If still doesn't work:</strong> Unconform, delete clothing, reload fresh, conform again</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                <h3>Issue 5: Multiple Clothing Items Interfering</h3>

                <div class="card" style="background-color: #fff3cd; border-left: 4px solid #ffc107;">
                    <h4>⚠️ The "Too Crowded" Problem</h4>
                    <p><strong>Symptom:</strong> Layered clothing clipping through each other</p>
                    <p><strong>Solutions:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Apply progressive expand morphs:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Inner layer: 0 or +0.1</li>
                                <li>Middle layer: +0.2 to +0.3</li>
                                <li>Outer layer: +0.4 to +0.6</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Load in correct order:</strong> Inside out</li>
                        <li><strong>Consider alternatives:</strong> Some clothing combinations just don't work well together</li>
                        <li><strong>Hide inner layers:</strong> If not visible, hide them to reduce clipping</li>
                    </ul>

                <h3>Issue 6: Smart Props in Wrong Location</h3>

                <div class="card" style="background-color: #fff3cd; border-left: 4px solid #ffc107;">
                    <h4>⚠️ The "Glasses on the Floor" Problem</h4>
                    <p><strong>Symptom:</strong> Smart prop parents correctly but positioned wrong</p>
                    <p><strong>Causes & Solutions:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Figure morphs:</strong>

                                <li>Smart prop positioned for default figure</li>
                                <li>Your figure has different proportions (bigger head, etc.)</li>
                                <li>Solution: Manually adjust position and scale</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                    <p><strong>Solutions:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Make sure clothing is selected:</strong> Not figure—the actual clothing item</li>
                        <li><strong>Expand all categories:</strong> Morphs may be in Body → Morphs or other nested locations</li>
                        <li><strong>Check different body parts:</strong> Some morphs are under specific body parts (Chest, Hip, etc.)</li>
                        <li><strong>Clothing may have limited morphs:</strong> Not all clothing comes with extensive morphs</li>
                        <li><strong>Use search:</strong> Some parameter panels have search function</li>

                    <h3 style="color: white; margin-top: 0;">🎯 Key Takeaways</h3>
                    
                    <h4 style="color: white;">Understanding the Fundamentals</h4>
                    <ul style="color: white;">
                        <li><strong>Conforming clothing:</strong> Specially rigged clothing that automatically wraps around and follows figure poses</li>
                        <li><strong>The magic of rigging:</strong> Clothing has matching bone structure to figures, enabling automatic posing</li>
                        <li><strong>Figure compatibility:</strong> Clothing must be designed for your specific figure type</li>
                        <li><strong>Types of wearables:</strong> Conforming clothing, smart props, dynamic cloth, and regular props each serve different purposes</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 style="color: white;">The Conforming Workflow</h4>
                    <ul style="color: white;">
                        <li><strong>Loading sequence:</strong> Load clothing, conform to figure, clothing wraps and follows poses</li>
                        <li><strong>Auto-conform vs manual:</strong> Some clothing conforms automatically, others need Figure → Conform To command</li>
                        <li><strong>Verification:</strong> Check hierarchy panel to confirm conforming status</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 style="color: white;">Adjusting Fit with Morphs</h4>
                    <ul style="color: white;">
                        <li><strong>Fit morphs:</strong> Tighten or loosen clothing to match figure's body shape</li>
                        <li><strong>Style morphs:</strong> Change clothing appearance (sleeve length, hem, details)</li>
                        <li><strong>Matching morphs:</strong> Apply corresponding morphs when figure has body modifications</li>
                        <li><strong>Small adjustments:</strong> Start with values of +0.1 to +0.3 and increase as needed</li>
                        <li><strong>Poke-through solutions:</strong> 90% of fit issues solved with proper morph application</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 style="color: white;">Smart Props and Accessories</h4>
                    <ul style="color: white;">
                        <li><strong>Auto-parenting magic:</strong> Smart props automatically attach to correct body parts on load</li>
                        <li><strong>Common smart props:</strong> Glasses, hats, jewelry, hair—anything that goes on specific body parts</li>
                        <li><strong>Fine-tuning:</strong> May need minor position/scale adjustments for perfect fit</li>
                        <li><strong>Multiple figures:</strong> Smart props parent to currently selected figure</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 style="color: white;">Layering Mastery</h4>
                    <ul style="color: white;">
                        <li><strong>Loading order:</strong> Inside-out (underwear → base → mid → outer → accessories)</li>
                        <li><strong>Progressive expansion:</strong> Each outer layer needs bigger morphs than layer beneath it</li>
                        <li><strong>Layer relationships:</strong> Inner +0.1, middle +0.3, outer +0.5 (typical values)</li>
                        <li><strong>Visual authenticity:</strong> Inner layers should be visible at edges (collars, cuffs)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 style="color: white;">Performance Optimization</h4>
                    <ul style="color: white;">
                        <li><strong>Hide covered body parts:</strong> Improves performance and eliminates poke-through</li>
                        <li><strong>Visibility toggle:</strong> Use hierarchy panel's eye icon to hide/show</li>
                        <li><strong>Strategic hiding:</strong> Hide what camera will never see and what's completely covered</li>
                        <li><strong>Performance gain:</strong> Can reduce geometry by 40-70% depending on outfit</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 style="color: white;">Troubleshooting</h4>
                    <ul style="color: white;">
                        <li><strong>Poke-through:</strong> Apply fit morphs, hide body parts, adjust pose slightly</li>
                        <li><strong>Won't conform:</strong> Check figure compatibility, ensure figure is loaded</li>
                        <li><strong>Clothing explodes:</strong> Reset to T-pose before loading clothing</li>
                        <li><strong>Layering conflicts:</strong> Progressive expand morphs and correct loading order</li>
                        <li><strong>Systematic approach:</strong> Check obvious first, try simple solutions, escalate if needed</li>
                    </ul>

                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>The Workflow Becomes Second Nature</h3>

                <p>
                    At first, dressing a character might seem like a lot of steps. But after you've done it a few times, the workflow becomes automatic:
                </p>

                <div class="mermaid">
                    graph LR
                    A[Load Figure] --> B[Load Clothing<br/>Inside-Out]
                    B --> C[Conform Each<br/>Item]
                    C --> D[Check Fit<br/>Apply Morphs]
                    D --> E[Add Accessories<br/>Smart Props]
                    E --> F[Pose Figure]
                    F --> G[Hide Covered<br/>Body Parts]
                    G --> H[Final Polish]
                    
                    style A fill:#667eea,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff
                    style H fill:#4CAF50,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff
                </div>

                <p>
                    Soon you'll be dressing characters without thinking about each step—it becomes muscle memory. Your focus shifts from "how do I do this" to "what look do I want to create."
                </p>

                <h3>Building Your Clothing Library Knowledge</h3>

                <p>
                    As you work more with Poser, you'll become familiar with what's in your clothing library:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Know your inventory:</strong> What clothing options you have available</li>
                    <li><strong>Favorite items:</strong> Certain pieces you use frequently</li>
                    <li><strong>Quality awareness:</strong> Which clothing items have good morphs and fit well</li>
                    <li><strong>Compatibility knowledge:</strong> What works with what figure</li>
                    <li><strong>Style combinations:</strong> Outfits that work well together</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    This familiarity makes character creation much faster—you know exactly where to find the perfect jacket for a character concept!
                </p>

                <h3>What's Next?</h3>

                    <li>Build complete scenes</li>

                <p>
                    Next up in Module 4, we'll explore <strong>Materials and Textures</strong>—because a well-dressed character deserves materials that look as good as the outfit fits. You'll learn to customize colors, apply textures, and make your characters' clothing look photorealistic!
                </p>
