                <p class="lead">
                    You've mastered standing poses, hand gestures, and facial expressions—now it's time to bring your characters to life with <strong>movement and action</strong>! Dynamic poses like walking, running, jumping, and fighting transform static figures into characters caught in the middle of exciting moments. These poses tell stories of action, energy, and motion frozen in time.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    Action poses are more challenging than static poses because they must convey movement while maintaining believable balance and physics. A great action pose makes viewers feel the momentum, anticipate what happens next, and understand the character's intention. In this lesson, you'll learn the principles and techniques for creating compelling action poses that capture energy and movement.

                <h2>⚡ Why Action Poses Matter</h2>
                
                <p>
                    Static standing poses are great for character sheets and portraits, but <strong>action poses bring stories to life</strong>. They capture moments of drama, excitement, and energy. A character mid-jump tells a different story than the same character standing still. Action poses add:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Energy and excitement:</strong> Movement = visual interest and engagement</li>
                    <li><strong>Storytelling power:</strong> Action implies cause and effect, before and after</li>
                    <li><strong>Character personality:</strong> How someone moves reveals who they are</li>
                    <li><strong>Professional polish:</strong> Dynamic poses separate beginners from experienced artists</li>
                </ul>

                <blockquote>
                    <p><strong>"Action poses are about capturing a single moment in time that tells the story of movement."</strong> Think of them as freeze-frames from an ongoing motion sequence.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    The challenge with action poses is that they must look <em>believable while defying static logic</em>. A jumping character isn't balanced—they're falling through space. A running character is in controlled falling. Your job is to capture that perfect moment where the action reads clearly and the physics feel right.
                </p>

                <h2>🚶 The Walking Cycle</h2>
                
                <p>
                    Walking is the foundation of all action poses. Understanding the walk cycle teaches you about weight transfer, balance, and natural movement. Even if you never animate, knowing the walk cycle helps you create believable standing and moving poses.
                </p>

                <h3>The Four Key Positions</h3>

                <p>
                    A complete walking cycle has four main positions (per leg):

                        <li><strong>Hips:</strong> Slight forward tilt, rotate slightly toward front leg</li>
                        <li><strong>Spine:</strong> Gentle forward lean (walking has momentum)</li>

                        <li><strong>Shoulders:</strong> Slight rotation opposite to hips</li>

                    <p>
                        Walk around your room and pay attention to your own body. Feel which leg has weight, how your arms naturally swing, when your heel strikes. <strong>You are your best reference for natural movement!</strong>

                <h2>⚖️ Dynamic Balance and Center of Gravity</h2>
                
                <p>
                    Action poses require understanding <strong>dynamic balance</strong>—balance in motion. Unlike static standing poses where weight is distributed over both feet, action poses often show transitional moments where balance is temporary or actively being lost (in a controlled way).
                </p>

                <h3>The Center of Gravity Principle</h3>

                <p>
                    The center of gravity (COG) is roughly at the pelvis/lower abdomen area. In a static standing pose, the COG should be over the base of support (the feet). In action poses:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Stable action:</strong> COG stays over support (walking, careful movements)</li>
                    <li><strong>Unstable action:</strong> COG moves outside support (running, jumping, falling)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    The key to believable action poses: <strong>the body should look like it's moving to maintain or recover balance</strong>, not like it's frozen mid-fall.
                </p>

                <div class="card" style="background: #fff3cd; border-left: 4px solid #ffc107;">
                    <h4>⚠️ Common Balance Mistake</h4>
                    <p>
                        Beginners create action poses where the character would immediately fall over if time unfroze. The pose looks "action-y" but physically impossible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>The test:</strong> Imagine the pose continuing—would the character catch themselves, or crash? If they'd crash, adjust the pose until momentum looks plausible.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>Weight Distribution in Action</h3>

                <p>
                    Different actions have different weight patterns:
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Running:</strong> Weight alternates rapidly, often on one foot. Body leans forward into direction of travel. Arms and legs pump in opposition.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Jumping (takeoff):</strong> Weight compressed down (crouch), legs coiled. Arms beginning upward swing for momentum.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Jumping (peak):</strong> Body extended, no weight on ground. Arms up for height. Looks momentarily weightless.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Landing:</strong> Knees bent to absorb impact, body low, arms out for balance. Weight compressing into ground.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Fighting stance:</strong> Weight distributed evenly or on back leg. Body angled, arms ready. Stable but prepared to move.

                    <p>
                        Ask yourself: <strong>"What happened right before this moment, and what happens next?"</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you can answer both questions and the pose makes sense in that sequence, you've got good dynamic balance. The pose should feel like a snapshot from ongoing action, not a random frozen position.

                <h2>📏 Line of Action</h2>
                
                <p>
                    The <strong>line of action</strong> is one of the most important concepts in dynamic posing. It's an imaginary curved line that runs through the figure's body, showing the main thrust and energy of the pose.
                </p>

                <h3>What Is the Line of Action?</h3>

                <p>
                    Think of the line of action as the spine or backbone of the pose's energy. It typically runs from head through torso to legs (or arms if they're important to the action). A strong line of action makes poses:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Dynamic and energetic</strong> - Clear direction and flow</li>
                    <li><strong>Readable</strong> - Viewers instantly understand the pose</li>
                    <li><strong>Balanced</strong> - The curve suggests weight and counterbalance</li>
                    <li><strong>Appealing</strong> - Curved lines are naturally more pleasing than straight ones</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Types of Lines of Action</h3>

                <p>
                    <strong>C-curve:</strong> The figure curves in one direction (like a "C"). Common in leaning, reaching, or bending poses. Creates flow and grace.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>S-curve:</strong> The figure curves in two directions (like an "S"). Creates contrast and visual interest. Classic for dynamic poses—shoulders lean one way, hips the other.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Straight line:</strong> The figure is relatively straight. Less dynamic but works for specific actions like standing at attention, lying flat, or rigid poses.
                </p>

                <h3>Using Line of Action in Poser</h3>

                <p>
                    When creating an action pose:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Envision the line first</strong> - Before touching controls, imagine the energy line</li>
                    <li><strong>Pose the spine</strong> - Bend and twist the torso to follow your imagined line</li>
                    <li><strong>Add contrast</strong> - If hips go left, shoulders go right (creates S-curve)</li>
                    <li><strong>Extend limbs</strong> - Arms and legs follow or complement the main line</li>
                    <li><strong>Check from camera</strong> - The line of action should be clear from the main viewing angle</li>
                </ol>

                    <h4>✅ Line of Action Quick Check</h4>
                    <p>
                        Take a screenshot of your pose. Draw a line through the main energy flow. Is it:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Clear and easy to draw?</li>
                        <li>Curved and flowing (not rigid)?</li>
                        <li>Following the action's direction?</li>
                        <li>Creating an appealing shape?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        If yes to all four, you have a strong line of action!
